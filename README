Accounting and access control for "roaming" Unix domain users.
NetUsher allows users to "roam" between computers on local net
while still accountable by AAA systems like Radius or NetAMS.

Current features

- PAM integration
- Get traffic counters from OpenVPN
- Detecting user login methods (GDM/KDM/XDM, RSH/SSH, console, X terminal)
- Detecting non-LDAP users
- Authorizing users through LDAP
- MySQL support
- IPtable modification
- Web UI
- Group mirroring

Planned features

- Integration with NeTAMS
- Get traffic counters from IPtables
- Use SAWstats as a graphing frontend (SAWstats will take host-to-user mappings from UserWatch)
- More than one logged in user per host and automatic determining of traffic shares
- Rewrite uwclient and uwserver in pure C. This will remove dependency on buggy Net::SSLeay
  (eg. due to bugs in Net::SSLeay we cannot have our own SSL connections and LDAPS simultaneously)
